# pdf_Label
When you run the executable, a file selector will appear. You can select a PDF and a CSV file using this selector. The program will then create a new file with the 'with_label' suffix added to the PDF file's name and save it in the same folder.

> When you initially execute the .exe file, Windows Defender will display a warning message advising against running it.
